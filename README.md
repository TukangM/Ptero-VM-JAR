# ⚠️ Maintenance Notice
This project is no longer maintained and has been superceded by Harbor, please use that instead as it is a lot better, has a smaller footprint and simply just runs a lot better. It includes wrappers for Python, Javascript (NodeJS) and Java (Kotlin) and supports both x86_64 and AARCH64 CPU architectures. Thank you for your continued support and I hope to see you there.
